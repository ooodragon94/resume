# Jekyll Theme for Resume
> Designed by Xiaoying Riley at [3rd Wave Media](http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/),  
> Made into jekyll theme by [sharu725](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv)

I modified this theme for personal use.  
Added/Removed some topics, and added navigation bar on the top.


## Installation

* Fork this repository
* Go to settings and set Github Pages source as master.
* Change `_config.yml` to fit to your settings. 
* Your site should be ready at `https://your-username.github.io/resume/`

Change all the details from one place: ``_data/data.yml``
