      time: 2020.03 - 2022.02
      company: <a href="https://www.keti.re.kr/eng/main/main.php">Korea Electronics Technology Institute(KETI)</a>
      topic: Image Recognition
      details: |
        Project on compression deep neural network to implement on a chip.
        - Contributed on Model compression algorithm; Knowledge Distillation, Pruning to compress Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).
        - Used TensorRT to optimize network inference speed on Jetson Nano.

    - title: <a href="https://github.com/ooodragon94/binary-pytorch">Binary Network</a>
      time: 2021.07 - current
      company: GIST
      topic: Image Recognition
      details: |
        Researched on Binary Network, an extreme case of quantization.
        - Researched on better performing binary network with removing high quantization error inducing filters.
        - Researched on Binary Network Architecture Search with pruning.
        - Binary Network application (currently working on this, no specification allowed. Planning to submit to NeurIPS2023)

    - title: <a href="https://github.com/ooodragon94/prune-pytorch">Network Pruning</a>
      time: 2021.02 - 2021.06
      company: GIST
      topic: Image Recognition
      details: |
        Researched on filter pruning which is a subfield of network pruning.
        - Researched on zero shot pruning, a pruning technique which estimates importance score without any data given.
        - Researched on index matching while filter pruning. After the advent of residual network, this field has not progressed. However, it is one of the most important problem to solve.


    - title: Noise Removal with only noisy images

      company: GIST
      topic: Noise Removal
      details: |
        Given only training image, we can estimate real error with Stein's unbiased risk estimate(SURE).\
        Using SURE, we researched on denoising method only with noisy images.

      time: 2020.07 - 2020.09
      company: GIST
      topic: Privacy
      details: |
        Research on generating images with no privacy concern.
        - Deep learning needs data to learn.
        - This has critial privacy concern and must be solved.
        - For this, we researched on generating images only with downstream task related information.
        
    - title: <a href="https://github.com/ooodragon94/KD-Augmentation-with-supervision-pytorch">Knowledge Distillation</a>
      time: 2020.03 - 2020.04
      company: GIST
      topic: Image Recognition
      details: |
        Researched on logit distillation, also known as dark knowledge distillation.
        - Distillation with large teacher on a restricted resource.
        - Many try to overcome the large teacher memory for distillation by saving its inference results.
        - However, this will give deterministic results even with different transformation.
        - Researched on a learned network that will change the teacher logit regarding to the applied transformation.
